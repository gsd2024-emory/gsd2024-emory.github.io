		  Boosted generalized normal distributions: Forecasting patient wait and service times in emergency departments
        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Donald Lee</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>Applications of ML techniques sometimes ignore important knowledge from the domain it is applied to. For example, it is known that the distribution of patient wait times in an emergency department (ED) is approximately exponential, but current wait time forecasts ignore this information. To incorporate distributional knowledge into ML forecasts, we introduce a rigorous tree boosting procedure for estimating generalized normal distributions (bGND). We show that bGND performs 6% better than the distribution-agnostic ML benchmark in the distributional forecasting of patient wait times, which translates into a 9% increase in patient satisfaction and an increase in hospital earnings of $120,000 for every 10,000 visits. Similar improvements are also shown for patient service time forecasts using bGND.

	    Order Selection for Clustering Multivariate Extremes
        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Ray (Shuyang) Bai</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>
	    In extreme value theory, the so-called spectral measure summarizes the directional dependence pattern of extreme values across different variables. Several recent works have related spherical clustering techniques to the estimation of models with a discrete spectral measure. Yet, the problem of determining the order, i.e., the number of distinct atoms of the spectral measure, remains unexplored. In this work, we develop an order selection method that, on the theoretical side, consistently recovers the true order, and on the practical side, enjoys intuitive and simple implementation. Our method is based on a variant of the well-known Silhouette method.  In particular, we introduce an additional penalty term to the so-called simplified average silhouette width, which discourages small cluster sizes and small dissimilarities between cluster centers. The optimal order is chosen by visualizing the bending of the penalized average silhouette width curve (as a function of the order selected) when the tuning parameter of the penalty term increases. As a consequence, this method consistently estimates the order of a max-linear factor model, for which an usual information-criterion-based method is not applicable. Simulation studies demonstrate the bias-correcting effect of the penalty introduced. The method is also illustrated on a river discharge data set for stations located throughout the US. The order selected by our method matches the geographical context of these stations. This is a joint work with Shiyuan Deng and He Tang.

	    Functional Differential Equation Model for Dynamic System
        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Ruiyan Luo</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>
	    One major limitation of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model is that it assumes the derivatives of the system only depend on the concurrent values. This concurrent assumption can oversimplify the mechanism of dynamic systems and limit the applicability of differential equations.  To address the limitation, we propose a general Functional Differential Equation (FDE) model which allows the derivative to explicitly depend on both the current value and a historical segment of the system through an operator whose form is unknown. The operator maps functions defined in infinite-dimension spaces to scalars. To construct the operator and build the FDE from noisy observations, we propose a new family of estimators, called the Functional Neural Networks (FNN) with a smooth hidden layer, and establish the universal approximation property which states that any operator under mild regularity conditions can be well estimated by the members of this family.   With this theorem, we propose a penalized moving window integrated least squares method to construct an estimate of the FDE and make forecasts. The FDE method displays an obvious advantage in forecasting by simulations and application in sunspot data.

Bayesian Jackknife Empirical Likelihood-based Inference for Missing Data and Causal Inference Problems        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Yichuan Zhao</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>
	    Missing data reduces the representativeness of the sample and can lead to inference problems. This study applied the Bayesian jackknife empirical likelihood method for inference with missing data that were missing at random and causal inference. The semiparametric fractional imputation estimator, propensity score weighted estimator, and doubly robust estimator were used for constructing the jackknife pseudo values which were needed for conducting Bayesian jackknife empirical likelihood-based inference with missing data. Existing methods, such as normal approximation and jackknife empirical likelihood, were compared with the Bayesian jackknife empirical likelihood approach in a simulation study. The proposed approach had better performance in many scenarios in terms of the behavior of credible intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrated the application of the proposed approach for causal inference problems in a study of risk factors for impaired kidney function.

	    Enhancing fraud detection with graph neural networks
        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Shijie Cui</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>
	    Detecting fraudulent activities is crucial for loss prevention across industries. This task is complex and constantly evolving due to the dynamic and interconnected nature of activities. Traditional fraud detection techniques often focus on transactions in isolation, missing the intricate relationships between entities such as users and service providers. This talk presents the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in fraud detection in real world. Graph-based approaches allow us to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that traditional methods miss. It has potential to offer a scalable, robust solution for enhancing fraud prevention efforts.

	    Sample Complexity of Risk-Neutral Optimal Control with Application to Vaccination Scheduling for Epidemic Control
        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Johannes Milz</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>
	    The SEIR model is a widely used framework for simulating the spread of infectious diseases, and optimal control problems can be formulated to design effective intervention strategies, such as vaccination schedules. However, the SEIR model's parameters are often uncertain. To account for this, we model the parameters as random variables and formulate a risk-neutral optimal control problem by the average over their possible values. Building on this idea, we consider a broad class of risk-neutral optimal control problems involving nonlinear ordinary differential equations with uncertain inputs. By sampling these uncertain inputs, we approximate the original problem using empirical risk minimization. Leveraging metric entropy techniques, we derive non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds for the sample-based optimal values and critical points. Numerical simulations for the vaccination scheduling problem validate our theoretical findings. This is joint work with Olena Melnikov.

	    Adaptive Sampling Approaches for Real-time Data-Driven Decision-Making
        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Xiaochen Xian</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>
	    Advances in sensor technology have given rise to a highly data-intensive environment, enabling real-time decision-making by continuously collecting, processing, and analyzing vast amounts of information. In this talk, two adaptive sampling works will be presented in the context of real-time data-driven decision-making. 
    	</p>
	<p>
	    The first work proposes adaptive testing resource allocation strategies to dynamically allocate limited testing resources among different communities during infectious diseases, on top of a physics-informed model with account for transmission dynamics and health disparity for effective health risk assessment despite limited data. By integrating nonstationary Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) techniques which strike superior balance between exploration on the communities with high uncertainties of health risks and exploitation on those with high risk levels, the proposed methodology facilitates testing resource allocation among different communities to collect high-quality testing data for quick detection of disease outbreaks. The second work proposes pathwise sampling strategies using moving sensors to quickly identify abrupt changes in an area of interest in real time considering their pathwise movement constraints. To tackle challenges due to variability and partial observability of online observations, we integrate instruments of statistical process control and mathematical optimization to monitor the global status of the area of interest and adaptively adjust paths of MVSs to sample from suspicious locations based on real-time data. Theoretical investigations and simulation studies will be presented to validate the superior performance of the proposed methods.

	    Flexible Bayesian Product Mixture Models for Vector Autoregressions
	</h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Joshua Lukemire</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> 
	    Bayesian non-parametric methods based on Dirichlet process mixtures have seen tremendous success in various domains and are appealing in being able to borrow information by clustering samples that share identical parameters. However, these methods can face hurdles in heterogeneous settings where samples are expected to cluster only along a subset of axes or where clusters of samples share only a subset of identical parameters. We overcome such limitations by developing a novel class of product of Dirichlet process location-scale mixtures that enables independent clustering at multiple scales. First, we develop the approach for independent multivariate data. Subsequently we generalize it to multivariate time-series data under the framework of multi-subject Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models that is our primary focus, which go beyond parametric single-subject VAR models. We establish posterior consistency and develop efficient posterior computation for implementation. Extensive numerical studies involving VAR models show distinct advantages over competing methods in terms of estimation, clustering, and feature selection accuracy. Our resting state fMRI analysis from the Human Connectome Project reveals connectivity differences between distinct fluid intelligence groups.
