            Moderna COVE Trial</h4>

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> Randomized, double-blind phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials assess how well candidate vaccines prevent
            infection and disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The NIH-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN)
            is co-conducting (with vaccine manufacturers) five such phase 3 trials, which include the objective to
            assess post-vaccination antibody biomarkers as various types of “immune correlates of protection (CoPs).”
            CoPs can be formally defined using several statistical frameworks, including risk prediction, treatment
            effect modification, treatment effect mediation, and surrogate/replacement endpoint evaluation. An ultimate
            application of the statistical analyses is to help define surrogate endpoints that can constitute the basis
            for traditional or accelerated approval of vaccines. In this talk I will first summarize the statistical
            design of the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials, and secondly describe the results of the first CoVPN study
            (Moderna COVE study) yielding results on CoPs. In COVE, antibody markers were measured via a two-phase
            case-cohort sampling design. Based on controlled effects causal inference, vaccine recipients with
            post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers that had value undetectable (&#60 2.42), 100, or 1000,
            respectively, vaccine efficacy estimates were 51% (95% CI -51, 83%), 91% (87, 94%), and 96% (94, 98%),
            respectively. Moreover, based on natural effects mediation analysis, an estimated 68% (58, 78%) of the
            vaccine's overall efficacy was mediated through neutralizing antibody titers. These results help define a
            biomarker with utility to influence decision-making for COVID-19 vaccines. Statistical issues in assessing
            and interpreting CoPs are discussed.

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>Technological advances have led to an explosion in researchers' and clinicians' ability to collect
            high-dimensional time series signals. The ability to fully utilize these data has been inhibited by shortage
            of parsimonious yet flexible methods that can be used to learn and conduct inference on dynamic frequency
            patterns. Motivated by high-density EEG (hdEEG) from a patient receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation
            (TMS) while hospitalized for a first-break psychotic episode, in this talk we discuss a nonparametric
            approach to the spectral analysis of a high-dimensional multivariate nonstationary time series signal. The
            procedure is based on a novel frequency-domain factor model that provides a flexible yet parsimonious
            representation of spectral matrices from a large number of simultaneously observed time series (e.g. EEG
            from many locations in the brain). Formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, the time series is adaptively
            partitioned into approximately stationary segments, where both the number and location of partition points
            are assumed unknown. Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) techniques are used to accommodate the
            unknown number of segments, and a conditional Whittle likelihood-based Gibbs sampler is developed for
            efficient sampling within segments. By averaging over the distribution of partitions, the proposed method
            can approximate both abrupt and slowly varying changes in spectral matrices, and flexibly learn dynamic
            frequency patterns.

                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ping Ma</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>With the rapid development of quantum computers, quantum computing has been studied extensively. Unlike
            electronic computers, a quantum computer operates on quantum processing units, or qubits, which can take
            values 0, 1, or both simultaneously due to the superposition property. The number of complex numbers
            required to characterize quantum states usually grows exponentially with the size of the system. For
            example, a quantum system with p qubits can be in any superposition of 2^p orthonormal states
            simultaneously, while a classical system can only be in one state at a time. Such a paradigm change has
            motivated significant developments of scalable quantum algorithms in many areas.

            However, quantum algorithms tackling statistical problems are still lacking. In this talk, I will present
            challenges and opportunities for developing quantum algorithms. I will introduce a novel quantum algorithm
            for a statistical problem.

		  Notes from the field:  Teaching collaborators about best practices

        </h4>
        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Craig Borkowf</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>In this presentation, I share my personal perspective as an applied statistician on the best practices for reporting and interpreting p-values and statistical significance.  I first discuss my Branch's educational efforts to convey the ASA's recommendations (2016, 2019) on these practices to the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention.  In particular, I present a graphical example that shows the location of confidence intervals relative to chosen thresholds, which helps collaborators go beyond dichotomous statements about statistical significance and think carefully about meaningful effects from a public health perspective.  I then describe two approaches for engaging collaborators, noting some successes and challenges.  The first uses a color-coding method to illustrate whether the lower and upper confidence bounds rule out any benefit/harm or substantial benefit/harm.  The second focuses on writing text that accurately describes a study's limited ability both to detect small differences (even if they exist) and to rule out meaningful differences (even if they do not exist).  I conclude with some personal thoughts about how this educational initiative might progress in the next few years.

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> A century ago, when Student's t-statistic was introduced, no one ever imagined its increasing applicability
            in the modern era. It finds applications in highly multiple hypothesis testing, feature selection and
            ranking, high dimensional signal detection, etc. Student's t-statistic is constructed based on the empirical
            distribution function (EDF). An alternative choice to the EDF is the kernel density estimate (KDE), a
            smoothed version of the EDF. The novelty of the work consists of an alternative to Student's t-test that
            uses the KDE technique and exploration of the usefulness of the KDE-based t-test in the context of its
            application to large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing. An optimal bandwidth parameter for the KDE
            approach is derived by minimizing the asymptotic error between the true p-value and its asymptotic estimate
            based on normal approximation. We compare our method to several possible alternatives with respect to the
            false discovery rate. We show in simulations that our method produces a lower proportion of false
            discoveries than its competitors. The usefulness of the proposed methods is further illustrated through a
            gene expression data example.

        <p class="abname"><strong>Speaker: </strong><a>Linwei Hu</a>
        </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> There is a great deal of interest recently on machine learning interpretability, especially in regulated
            industries where one needs to understand and explain the results to various stakeholders. This talk presents
            a method called GAMI-Tree for developing inherently-interpretable machine learning models. It is based on a
            functional ANOVA decomposition of the model and estimating just the main effects and low-order interactions.
            While this concept is known in statistics, the challenge is to develop fast and scalable algorithms to do
            non-parametric estimation with large datasets. Explainable boosting machine (EBM) was proposed in Lou et al.
            (2013) to address this challenge. Unlike EBM, GAMI-Tree uses customized model-based trees and performs as
            all as, or better than, EBM on simulated and real data sets. In addition, GAMI-Tree is better in capturing
            interaction effects as it uses more flexible base learner.

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> Many data in real-world applications are in a high-dimensional space but exhibit low-dimensional structures.
            In mathematics, these data can be modeled as random samples on a low-dimensional manifold. Our goal is to
            estimate a target function or a nonlinear operator between infinite dimensional function spaces by neural
            networks. This talk is based on an efficient approximation theory of deep ReLU networks for functions
            supported on a low-dimensional manifold. We further establish the sample complexity for regression and
            operator estimation with finite samples of data. When data are sampled on a low-dimensional manifold, the
            sample complexity crucially depends on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold instead of the ambient
            dimension of the data. These results demonstrate that deep neural networks are adaptive to low-dimensional
            geometric structures of data sets.

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> Smoothness penalty is an efficient regularization and dimension reduction tool for functional regression.
            However, for spiky functional data observed on a dense grid, the coefficient function in functional
            regression can be spiky and hence the smoothness regularization is inefficient and leads to over-smoothing.
            We propose a novel approach to fit the functional-on-function regression model by viewing the spiky
            coefficient functions as the derivatives of smooth auxiliary functions. Compared to smoothness
            regularization or sparsity regularization which are imposed directly on the spiky coefficient function in
            existing methods, imposing smoothness regularization on the smooth auxiliary functions can more efficiently
            reduce the dimension and improve the performance of fitted model. With the estimated smooth auxiliary
            functions and by taking derivatives, we can fit the model and make prediction. Simulation studies and real
            data applications show that compared to the existing methods, the new method can greatly improve model
            performance when the coefficient function is spiky, and performs similarly well when the coefficient
            function is smooth.

        <p> "Nested" and "multipart" studies are two ways of expanding the scope of a research program beyond what might
            otherwise be possible with available funding. Nested studies are cost-effective because they leverage the
            parent study infrastructure and personnel within which they are cocooned. Multipart studies are
            cost-effective because they leverage the same cohort of participants for use in interlinked research studies
            that share common components. There is little information on the practical implications of either nested or

        <p> Racial disparity adversely impacts COVID-19 infection and fatality rates. Hospitalization rates due to the
            pandemic among African Americans/Latinx/Hispanics in Georgia have been among the highest in the nation.
            Sociopolitical determinants also termed Social Vulnerability have been identified as one of the main factors
            plaguing minorities on the face of the burden of the pandemic. Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was
            developed by ATSDR at CDC . The basic formula projects how disaster unfolds: "(Risk = Hazard *
            (Vulnerability - Resources) where Risk is the likelihood or expectation of loss; Hazard is a condition
            posing the threat of harm; Vulnerability is the extent to which persons or things are likely to be affected;
            and Resources are those assets in place that will diminish the effects of hazards" (Dwyer et al. 2004; UCLA
            Center for Public Health and Disasters 2006). Using census-tract-specific percentile ranks, SVI was
            developed taking into account four domains including socioeconomic status, household composition, minority
            status and language and housing type and transportation. Along with SVI, we used GA Department of Public
            Health, CDC data and County Health Rankings & Roadmaps specific statistics to cross-sectionally and
            longitudinally employ (Poisson) Generalized Linear Mixed Models to functionally relate infection/death rates
            vis-a-vis % racial population difference (60+years %whites - %African Americans (AA)/Blacks), education,
            unemployed, uninsured, % obese and racial differences in respiratory infection discharge rates. We
            additionally but separately also modeled county-specific frequency and intensity of COVID-19 up to August
            30, 2021 as function of SVI, comorbid conditions, % obese, vaccination rates and insurance status. Analyses
            also evaluated the sensitivity of SVI in predictive models in lieu of socioeconomic variables
            (ethnicity/race, income, education, gender and age). Results revealed the magnitude and the significance of
            the burden posed by social vulnerability in response to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Older age,
            male gender, AA /other minority group, presence of comorbid conditions, obesity and lower vaccination rates
            also independently but adversely predicted higher COVID-19 infection and related mortality rates. SVI
            significantly correlated with these findings.

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> In practice, clinicians synthesize information on patient characteristics, such as medical history and life
            style, to tailor a sequence of treatment decisions for the patient. The goal of precision medicine is to
            make this clinical decision-making process evidence-based, and find optimal treatment rules to maximize the
            likelihood of desirable outcomes. Unfortunately, the full benefit of a treatment regime may not be realized
            since patients often do not fully adhere to the treatment plan due to toxic side effects of the medication.
            In this talk, we describe how we can combine tools from causal inference, mediation analysis, and
            reinforcement learning to account for differential adherence while learning high quality policies and
            decision rules.

        <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>Resting-state fMRI studies remove participants that fail motion quality control criteria. Motion is
            particularly problematic in studies on children and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum
            disorder (ASD). In ASD studies, popular motion quality control criteria result in the removal of the
            majority of children. Moreover, children with more severe ASD are more likely to be excluded. To address the
            sampling bias, we define a target parameter for the difference in functional connectivity between ASD and
            typically developing children. We call this target parameter the deconfounded group difference, which
            utilizes the distribution of diagnosis-specific behavioral variables across usable and unusable scans. We
            estimate the deconfounded group difference using doubly robust targeted minimum loss-based estimation with
            an ensemble of machine learning methods for the propensity and outcome models. In a study of ASD and
            typically developing children, we find more extensive differences than the naive estimator. Our findings
            suggest the deconfounded group difference can reveal the pathophysiology of neurological disorders in
            populations with high motion.

        <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>CDC and its public health partners are undergoing a transformative data modernization to move from siloed and
            brittle public health data systems to connected, resilient, adaptable, and sustainable "response-ready"
            systems that can help us solve problems before they happen and reduce the harm caused by the problems that
            do happen. This transformation aims to build a new digital infrastructure with increased data access, data
            harmonization, and shared tools and services to support the data lifecycle. The new digital infrastructure
            will allow public health to leverage advanced statistical methods such as machine learning. With modernized
            digital infrastructure, public health will be better able to monitor the complex, interconnected dimensions
            of health and to predict and forecast future pandemics and non-infectious threats. This presentation will
            describe CDC’s data modernization strategy and vision.

        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p>This work illustrates how you can apply quantile process regression (QPR) to perform counterfactual analysis
            for cross-sectional data. QPR builds the probability distribution model for a response variable conditional
            on its associated explanatory covariates by fitting quantile regression models in the entire quantile-level
            range from 0 to 1. For cross-sectional treatment-control comparison studies, you can use QPR to predict
            counterfactual distributions of the responses for the treatment-group subjects. That predictions
            counterfactually assume the treatment-group subjects were in the control group. Because QPR estimates the
            entire response distributions, you can then evaluate treatment effects and
            treatment-control-subjects-selection bias by using a variety of statistical standards such as mean
            difference, median different, and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U test. In addition, when a continuous mediation
            variable is involved, QPR can furthermore predict the distribution of the mediation variable and perform
            causal mediation analysis. This work exemplifies the QPR counterfactual analysis methods by analyzing the
            impact of mothers smoking habits on newborns body weights.

                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ting Zhang</a> </p>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> </p>
        <p> Quantile regression serves as a popular and powerful approach for studying the effect of regressors on
            quantiles of a response distribution. However, existing results on quantile regression were mainly developed
            when the quantile level is fixed, and the data are often assumed to be independent. Motivated by recent
            applications, we consider the situation where (i) the quantile level is not fixed and can grow with the
            sample size to capture the tail phenomena; and (ii) the data are no longer independent but collected as a
            time series that can exhibit serial dependence in both tail and non-tail regions. To study the asymptotic
            theory for high quantile regression estimators in the time series setting, we introduce a previously
            undescribed tail adversarial stability condition, and show that it leads to an interpretable and convenient
            framework for obtaining limit theorems for time series that exhibit serial dependence in the tail region but
            are not necessarily strong mixing. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effect of tail
            dependence on high quantile regression estimators, where simply ignoring the tail dependence may lead to
            misleading p-values.
